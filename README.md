### 📊 Business Intelligence – Analytics & Reporting

#### 🎯 Objective
Develop SQL-based analytical queries to derive actionable insights in three key domains:

- 📈 **Sales Trends**:  
  Analyze performance over time, identify seasonality, and measure growth with running totals and moving averages.

- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Customer Behavior**:  
  Segment customers by spend and tenure, identify VIPs and new customers, and compute KPIs such as recency and average order value.

- 🚲 **Product Performance**:  
  Identify high-performing products and categories, segment by revenue and cost, and assess contribution to total sales.

These insights empower stakeholders to make **strategic, data-informed decisions**.
